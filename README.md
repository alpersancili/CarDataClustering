# 🚗 Car Data Clustering Project

This project focuses on clustering car data using machine learning techniques. The goal is to group cars based on features such as price, mileage, and cylinder count, and visualize these clusters in a 3D plot. The project leverages K-Means clustering and evaluates the optimal number of clusters using methods like the elbow method and silhouette score.

🔧 Project Overview
Key Features:
Clustering: Group cars based on price, mileage, and cylinder count.
3D Visualization: Visualize the clusters in 3D space using Plotly.
Evaluation Metrics: Use the elbow method and silhouette score to determine the optimal number of clusters.
Libraries Used:
pandas: For data manipulation.
scikit-learn: For K-Means clustering and metrics.
Plotly: For interactive 3D visualization.
Yellowbrick: For visualization of clustering metrics like silhouette score.

📊 Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains features related to cars:

Price: The price of the car.
Mileage: The total distance the car has traveled.
Cylinder: The number of cylinders in the car's engine.

🚀 Clustering Model
K-Means Clustering:
Number of Clusters: The number of clusters (k) is determined using the elbow method and silhouette score.
Cluster Assignment: Cars are grouped into clusters based on similarities in price, mileage, and cylinder count.
Evaluation Metrics:
Elbow Method: Used to determine the optimal number of clusters by evaluating the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS).
Silhouette Score: Measures how similar each point is to its own cluster compared to other clusters.

🌐 Visualization
3D Scatter Plot:
Plotly: Used to create an interactive 3D scatter plot, where each car is represented as a point in 3D space. The points are colored based on their cluster assignment.
Silhouette Visualizer:
Yellowbrick: Used to visualize the silhouette scores for the clusters, providing insight into the quality of the clustering.

🛠️ Future Improvements
Advanced Clustering Techniques: Experiment with other clustering algorithms like DBSCAN or Agglomerative Clustering.
Feature Engineering: Incorporate additional features, such as car age or brand, to improve clustering accuracy.
Interactive Dashboard: Expand the visualization with more interactive features and filters.
